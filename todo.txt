BUGS
- handle case where last part is deleted
- new frets show in different part on first selection
- handle long part names in mixer

OPTIMIZATION
- Preload notes when playing
- don't save defaults

CODE
- move serialize methods to service
- save note collection as is

UI
- hide tunes list if empty
- hide rivets templates while loading - show overlay?

UX
- Key events for play position: home, backwards/forwards with cursor
- associate play position with selected note
- skip between bars with play controls
- multi-select notes / copy & paste
- form validation
- set bpm by typing (editable div?)
- timeout on continuing fret number (e.g. editing a 2 -> 3 should just become a 3 instead of 23 after x seconds)
- add feedback messages

FUNCTIONALITY
- custom instruments
- pitch bend / hammer on / pull off
- add / remove bars - what if removing a bar with notes?
- Set note length / add rest notes
- import / export. Sync?
