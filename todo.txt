- don't save defaults
- index quavers in tablature controller
- optimise tablature service move selected note
- switch parts is slow

- configurable instrument fret count in tune service set note
- review range architecture

UI

UX
- Key events for play position: backwards/forwards with cursor

- undo / redo: just notes?

FUNCTIONALITY
