- Tune title continues editing on keypress after blur
- Selected range does not work through 0
- Bottom border of selected note disappears with selected range
- Shift-ctrl-cursor not working as expected

- optimise tablature service move selected note
- switch parts is slow

CODE

- configurable instrument fret count in tune service set note

UI
- hide tunes list if empty
- hide rivets templates while loading - show overlay?
- indicate editable content fields

UX
- Key events for play position: backwards/forwards with cursor
- Home key sets play position (and by extension, the play position)
- multi-select notes / copy & paste
- form validation
- set bpm by typing (editable div?)
- add feedback messages
- undo / redo: just notes?

FUNCTIONALITY
- custom instruments
- pitch bend / hammer on / pull off
- add / remove bars - what if removing a bar with notes?
- Set note length / add rest notes
- import / export. Sync?
