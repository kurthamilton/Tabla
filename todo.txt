BUGS
- handle case where last part is deleted
- handle long part names in mixer
- Tune title continues editing on keypress after blur
- Selected note lost when switching parts

OPTIMIZATION
- Preload notes when playing
- don't save defaults
- index quavers in tablature controller

CODE
- move serialize methods to service
- save note collection as is
- reuse audio service increment logic

UI
- hide tunes list if empty
- hide rivets templates while loading - show overlay?
- indicate editable content fields

UX
- Key events for play position: backwards/forwards with cursor
- multi-select notes / copy & paste
- form validation
- set bpm by typing (editable div?)
- add feedback messages
- undo / redo: just notes?

FUNCTIONALITY
- custom instruments
- pitch bend / hammer on / pull off
- add / remove bars - what if removing a bar with notes?
- Set note length / add rest notes
- import / export. Sync?
